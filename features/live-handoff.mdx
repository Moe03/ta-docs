Live handoff is a powerful feature that allows human agents to take over conversations from AI agents when necessary. This functionality bridges the gap between automated and personalized support, ensuring that complex queries or sensitive issues are handled with a human touch.

<Note>
Live handoff is closely integrated with the client dashboard, where it's operated when a client is logged in and available to manage conversations. Read more in the [whitelabel](/whitelabeling/whitelabeling) docs.
</Note>

## Setting Up Live Handoff

Before you can use live handoff, ensure that your agent is properly configured:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent settings tab">
    Navigate to your agent's settings tab. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable handoff">
    Enable the handoff functionality by clicking `Enable handoff popup` to allow the agent to display the handoff UI.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Handoff enabled">
    You can now access the live handoff from the agents conversation tab or by logging in to your client dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>


<Card title="Fixed handoff popup" icon="gear">
    If you want the agent to always show the handoff at the top of the agents UI. Enable `Fixed handoff popup` for a persistent handoff UI.
  </Card>

<Warning>
    You must assign the agent to an **organization** for the fixed handoff popup to work.
    </Warning>


## Set up handoff for client

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Assign Agent to an Organization">
    For the handoff to work and to ensure your client has the ability to use it, the agent must be assigned to an [organization](whitelabeling/whitelabeling/client-management/setting-up-organization).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create User Access">
    Ensure the organization has a [user](whitelabeling/whitelabeling/client-management/creating-a-user) who can log in to the client dashboard and that their widget is assigned to it.
  </Step>
</Steps>





<Info>
If you haven't granted your client access to **settings**, they won't be able to enable handoff themselves. Consider this when setting up [client permissions](/whitelabeling/whitelabeling/client-management).
</Info>

## Handling Unanswered Requests

To ensure no user query goes unanswered, TIXAE Agents offers a fallback option for users to submit a query directly in the chat:
