## Introduction

The UI Engine is a powerful feature in Orova Agents that enables your AI agents to create rich, interactive elements in their responses. This enhances user engagement by going beyond simple text exchanges.

<Warning>
This is an **experimental** feature and may not always work as expected. Use with caution and thoroughly test your implementation.
</Warning>

## Enabling the UI Engine

Enabling the UI engine appends further instructions to your system prompt, allowing your AI agent to output JSON data that renders UI elements like buttons, cards, carousels. While not directly a UI element, your agent can also show images and render iframes out of the box.To enable it, do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Prompt Tab">
    Open your agent's dashboard and go to the `Prompts` tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate UI Engine Checkbox">
    Find the UI Engine **checkbox** in the settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Feature">
    Check the box and `save`.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Instructing Your Agent

With the UI Engine enabled, you have several options for guiding your agent's use of UI components:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structured Instructions">
    Provide specific instructions in your initial or system prompt. For example:

    ```markdown
    Generate two buttons saying "Start Tutorial" and "Skip Introduction".
    Then, create a card with the title "Welcome", a brief description of our service, and an "Learn More" button.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guided Interaction">
    Set up a structured interaction flow in your system prompt:

    ```markdown
    Follow these steps in the conversation:
    1. Ask about the user's preference and generate three buttons: "Product Info", "Pricing", "Support".
    2. Based on their choice, display a relevant card with:
       - Title: [Chosen topic]
       - Brief description
       - "Get Details" button
    3. After showing the card, ask if they want to explore another topic or end the conversation.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Full Creative Freedom">
    Give your agent the freedom to generate UI components as it sees fit:

    ```markdown
    You have access to the UI Engine for creating interactive elements like buttons, cards, carousels, and images. Use these components when you believe they will enhance the user experience or make information presentation more effective. Be creative in your approach.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Note>
For information on integrating the UI Engine with your knowledge base, see our [KB and UI Engine](/agent-creation/knowledgebase/kb-and-ui-engine) page.
</Note>
<Tip>
Models like `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` are particularly adept at generating appropriate UI elements code and using these components **effectively**. When giving your agent creative freedom, consider using such advanced models for optimal results.
</Tip>

<Note>
The versatility of the UI components allows for numerous combinations and configurations. You can instruct your agent to create **complex elements** like a carousel of cards, each with its own image, description, and buttons.

<Tip>
Experiment with different component combinations to find the most effective way to present information and engage users in **your** specific use case.
</Tip>


## Best Practices

To make the most of the UI Engine:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Balance Text and UI" icon="scale-balanced">
    Mix textual responses with UI components for a rich, varied interaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Aware Components" icon="sitemap">
    Use UI elements that are relevant to the current conversation context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Enhancement" icon="layer-group">
    Start with essential information in text, then enhance with UI components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Different Approaches" icon="vial-circle-check">
    Experiment with structured instructions vs. creative freedom to find what works best for your use case.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Credit Usage Considerations

<Warning>
Enabling the UI Engine **increases** credit consumption per response due to the additional instructions appended to each interaction.
</Warning>

To manage credit usage effectively:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Usage">
    Regularly check your credit usage in the [Usage tab](/features/usage-tab).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optimize Interactions">
    Use UI components together with text responses to optimize usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inform Clients">
    If you're an agency, ensure your clients are aware of the potential increase in credit usage when the UI Engine is enabled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare and Adjust">
    Run comparisons of credit usage with and without the UI Engine to understand its impact on your specific use case.
  </Step>
</Steps>
