# What are Tools?

Tools, also known as <Tooltip tip="In the context of AI models, functions are predefined interfaces that allow the model to interact with external systems or perform specific operations. They are typically defined in JSON format, consisting of a name, description, and a set of parameters. This JSON structure enables structured data exchange between the AI and external services, allowing for precise control over inputs and outputs.">functions</Tooltip>, are custom capabilities that you can add to your AI agents. They allow your agents to perform specific actions or retrieve information from external sources, greatly enhancing their functionality and usefulness.


<Note>
Orova Agents sends parameters as a JSON array to your specified endpoint, enabling seamless integration with a wide range of automation platforms and servers. This flexibility allows you to create powerful, custom interactions between your AI agents and external systems.

## Default Tools
Your agents utilize the capabilities of tools right out of the box. These provide essential functionalities that form the backbone of your agents:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="KB-Search" icon="brain">
    The knowledgebase uses a tool to query and retrieve information by default. This significanlty enhances the output compared to other methods of retrieval. [Read more](/agent-creation/knowledgebase/about-the-knowledgebase).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live-handoff" icon="phone-flip">
    The live-handoff is a default tool that triggers whenever a user requests a live-handoff in the chat or via the handoff popup. [Read more](/features/live-handoff).

<img src="/images/features-ui-shots.png"></img>
    

   ### Input options for parameters 
    Each parameter has a set of values that needs to be filled in correctly for the tool to work:

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Parameter Key" icon="key">
        The name of the parameter **(e.g., "to", "subject", "html")**. Make this short and descriptive, this makes it easier for the LLM to interpret. 
      </Card>
      <Card title="Default Value" icon="square-1">
        An optional preset value for the parameter. Neat if you want a fixed parameter for every tool use. You can also set the parameter as `required`. The LLM will take this into consideration when collecting data from the user. 
      </Card>
      <Card title="Type" icon="code">
        Make sure to define the type of data your parameter will contain and where it will be placed in the request:
      <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="Data type:">(e.g., String, Number, Boolean)</Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Body or Header:">Whether the parameter is a part of the Header or Body of the request.</Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    After configuring your tool, make sure to `save`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Tools

Testing your tools in a **controlled environment** before going live is crucial. It's essential to understand how the webhook processes data and how the models behave when using a tool. This ensures that every user or client can send and receive requests seamlessly.

#
<Card title="Webhook Testing" icon="webhook" href="">
    You can test the tool's webhook with random **pre-filled data** in the parameters or fill in the parameters yourself. This is particularly useful when setting up automations and verifying functionality before implementing to the agents LLM.

## Tools and System Prompt 

When your tool is tested and ready to implement, your agent wont know when or exactly how to use it. This is where the system prompt comes into play where you instruct the agent on how it should use, which information it should collect and when it should use the tool.


### Example Prompt for Tools

Here are some examples of how you can instruct your agent to use tools in various scenarios:

<CodeGroup>
  ```markdown Lead Generation
  You have access to a tool called 'addLeadToCRM'. When a user expresses interest in our products or services, use this tool to add their information to our CRM system. The tool requires the following parameters:
  - name: The full name of the lead
  - email: The lead's email address
  - interest: A brief description of what they're interested in

  Always confirm with the user before adding their information to the CRM.
  ```

  ```markdown Fitness Planning
  You have access to two tools: 'createTrainingPlan' and 'createMealPlan'. Use these tools when users ask for fitness advice.

  For 'createTrainingPlan', you need:
  - fitnessLevel: beginner, intermediate, or advanced
  - goal: e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, endurance
  - daysPerWeek: number of training days

  For 'createMealPlan', you need:
  - dietType: e.g., vegetarian, keto, balanced
  - calorieTarget: daily calorie goal
  - allergies: list of any food allergies

  Gather this information from the user before using the tools.
  ```

  ```markdown Appointment Booking
  You have a 'scheduleAppointment' tool. Use this when users want to book a meeting or appointment. The tool needs:
  - customerName: Full name of the customer
  - serviceType: Type of service or meeting requested
  - preferredDate: User's preferred date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - preferredTime: User's preferred time (format: HH:MM)

  After scheduling, always confirm the details with the user.
  ```

  ```markdown Newsletter Subscription
  When you have successfully answered a user query or if the user express interest in subscribing to the newsletter, use the 'subscribeNewsletter' tool. It requires:
  - email: User's email address
  - name: User's full name
  - interests: Comma-separated list of topics they're interested in

  Always ask for explicit consent before subscribing a user.
  ```
