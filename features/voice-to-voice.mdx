In the era of advanced AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), voice interactions have reached unprecedented levels of naturalness. Orova Agent harnesses this technology by integrating with VAPI, a cutting-edge voice-to-voice platform, to provide your agents with lifelike conversational abilities.

<Note>
Voice-to-voice technology now incorporates natural speech patterns, including filler words like "mhmm" and "ya", making conversations feel more authentic. Users can even interrupt the AI mid-sentence, closely mimicking human-to-human interactions.
</Note>

This guide will walk you through setting up your VAPI profile and enabling voice-to-voice capabilities for your Orova Agent.

## Connecting to VAPI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a VAPI Account">
    Start by creating an account on VAPI. It's a straightforward process - simply head over to [VAPI's website]().
    
    <Tip>
      We love VAPI. For more detailed information, check out their [documentation](https://docs.vapi.ai/introduction).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Assistant">
    Once your account is set up, create an assistant on VAPI:
    - Choose from various voice providers (e.g., Elevenlabs, Cartesia, OpenAI)
    - Select a voice that fits your agent's persona (For instance, our agent Gia uses the "Hannah" voice from Cartesia)
    - Craft a well-formatted system prompt.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Obtain API Keys from VAPI">
    After setting up your assistant:
    1. Navigate to your profile in the left-hand corner
    2. Go to `API keys`
    3. Copy both your **private** and **public keys**

    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Orova Agent Credentials">
    **In Orova Dashboard:**
    1. Go to the `credentials tab`
    2. Paste your VAPI private and public keys in the appropriate fields
    3. For the Default Server URL secret, go back to VAPI, find it under settings > `Server URL`, and paste it in Orova Agent's credentials tab

  </Step>

  
</Steps>

## Integrating with Your Agent

Now that you've set up VAPI, it's time to enable voice capabilities for your Orova Agent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agent Channels Tab">
    Choose the agent you want to set up for voice interactions and navigate to the channels tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Voice Setup">
    Click the `Voice setup` button or click `connect` via the voice channel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Configuration">
    If set up correctly, you'll see a green checkbox as shown below:
    
    <img src="/images/voice-ui-shots.png" alt="Voice setup verification" width="700"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add VAPI Assistant ID">
    The last field you need to fill out is the `VAPI assistant ID`. You can find this in your VAPI dashboard - simply copy it from your assistant's details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Congrats" icon="party-horn">
    You've successfully set up voice-to-voice capabilities in Orova Agent, offering your users or clients an innovative way to interact with your brand.

<Info>
  During a live conversation with the VAPI agent, the interaction is **transcribed** and is added to your current conversation. You can review these transcripts in the [conversation tab](/features/conversations-tab) for later.

## Voice Integration Settings

The voice setup interface provides several options to customize how VAPI interacts with your agent:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sync KB with VAPI">
    **This option adds your agent's entire Knowledge Base (KB) to your VAPI assistant.**
    
    - Each synced document consumes `1 credit`
    - Orova Agent will inject your KB documents into the VAPI assistant whenever changes are made to the KB
    
    <Warning>
      VAPI currently has a limit of **20,000** characters per document.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync all on save">
    **Enable this to automatically update your VAPI assistant with changes made to your Orova Agent, including:**
    - Initial message
    - Knowledgebase documents
    - System prompt
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Eagerly show VAPI on Load">
    **When enabled, this option displays the VAPI popup at the start of a new conversation, asking the user if they want to talk with the AI.**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable VAPI on Web">
    This option adds a quick upload attachment button to the Orova Agent template. When a file is uploaded, it triggers an intent with the file URL in Voiceflow. Read more about the voiceflow integration [here](/integration/voiceflow).

    **You can customize the VAPI Web popup message in the provided input field.**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Max Monthly Minutes">
    If you want to **restrict** the usage of your VAPI assistant, this can be done by setting a limit for monthly usage.
