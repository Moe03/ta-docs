The Crawler is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of creating and maintaining your agent's knowledge base. By automatically scraping and importing content from specified websites, the crawler ensures your agent stays up-to-date with the latest information.

## How the Crawler Works

<Info>
  The crawler operates by systematically visiting web pages, extracting relevant content, and organizing it into makrdown suitable for your agent's knowledge base. This process involves crawling through links, scraping text, and formatting the data for optimal use by AI models.
</Info>

## Crawler Jobs

The core of the crawler functionality revolves around crawler jobs. Each job is associated with specific source URLs you want to crawl and is identified by a unique ID. The [developer API](/api-reference) offers several ways to interact with the crawler.

### Creating a New Crawler Job

To initiate a new crawler job, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Source URLs">
    Navigate to the crawler tab from the menu on the left side of your dashboard. Click on `new job` and Enter the main URL(s) you want the crawler to begin with (e.g., https://www.tixaeagents.ai).
    <Warning>
      Ensure you use valid URLs in the correct format: https://example.com
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Crawl Settings">
    There are two options to consider that determines the quality of the scrape:

    <Accordion title="Regular crawl">
      - Default option, costs **1 credit** per page scraped.
      
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Deep crawl">
      
      - Autoscrolls and forces loading of images for better quality. Costs **10 credits** per page.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh Rate">
    ## Set Crawler Refresh Rate

The crawler refresh rate determines how often the crawler will update the current job with potential new information from the scraped site. This is particularly useful for websites that update frequently, such as e-commerce sites.

<Tip>
  You can create separate crawler jobs for different sub-pages. This allows you to set different refresh rates for various sections of a website. For example, on a Shopify site, you might want to update `/collections/protein-powder` more frequently than the main page, as product information changes more often.
</Tip>

### Available Refresh Rate Options:


  ```bash Refresh Rates
  Every 1 hour
  Every 6 hours
  Every 12 hours
  Every 24 hours
  Every 7 days
  Never
  ```
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify Page Limit">
    Set the maximum number of pages to scrape for that job, ranging from **10** up to **500** pages.
    <Tip>
      Review the **sitemap** beforehand to determine the optimal number of pages to scrape. To view, write `/sitemap.xml` at the end of a valid URL. Ex. https://www.tixaeagents.ai/sitemap.xml or use [this](https://www.seowl.co/sitemap-extractor/)
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define URL Patterns">


  <Card title="Match URLs: Include subpages you want to scrape based on the source URL." icon="link">
    

 <Accordion title="Example: Match URLs">
        ```
        /collections
        /products
        /blog
        ```

        This would include URLs containing the above.
      </Accordion>

    </Card>
    <Card title="Unmatch Patterns: Specify URLs or patterns to exclude from the scrape." icon="filter">

    
    <AccordionGroup>
     
      <Accordion title="Example: Unmatch Patterns">
        ```
        /blog
        ```
        This would exclude any URLs containing "/blog"
      </Accordion>
