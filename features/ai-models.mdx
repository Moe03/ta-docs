  <Card title="Function Calling" icon="code-branch">
    Models with [tools](/features/tools) support enable advanced interactions
    through function calling, allowing for communications with external APIs.
    This capability is crucial for tasks requiring specific data formats or
    integrations with external systems.

    , ideal for real-time applications. This technology significantly reduces
    latency, making these models perfect for scenarios where quick response
    times are critical.

    , allowing them to process and understand longer inputs. This is
    particularly useful for tasks involving extensive documents or complex,
    multi-turn conversations.

## Choosing the Right Model

Selecting the appropriate model for your project depends on various factors:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Complexity" icon="brain">
    For intricate tasks, consider `GPT-4o`, `Claude-3-opus-20240229` and
    `Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, or `Gemini-1.5-pro` models.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Response Speed" icon="bolt">
    Groq-powered models, especially `LLaMA-3.1-8b-instant` and `Gemma-7b-it`,
    excel in scenarios requiring rapid responses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context Length" icon="arrow-up-right-dots">
    Models like `GPT-4-0 (128k)`, `Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (2 Million)`,
    `Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 (200k)`, and `LLaMA3-70b-8192 (128k)` offer
    extended context for handling longer inputs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Integration" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Choose models with [tools](/features/tools) support for advanced function
    calling capabilities, such as `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4o-mini`, `GPT-4-32k`, `GPT-4`,
    `Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`, `Gemini-1.5-pro`, and
    `LLaMA-3.1-70b-versatile`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resource Efficiency" icon="leaf">
    Smaller models like `GPT-3.5-turbo`, `GPT-4-o-mini`,
    `Claude-3-haiku-20240307`, `Gemini-1.5-flash`, and `LLaMA-3.1-8b-instant`
    can be more cost-effective and faster for simpler tasks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Experiment with different models to find the best balance between writing
  styles, capabilies and efficiency for your agents use case.
