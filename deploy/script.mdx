# Script
You can deploy Orova with a script.

## Overview

This guide shows how to deploy the voice orb as an embeddable script on your website. Using the script version, you can integrate the voice orb without a full React setup. Simply include the script on your page and initialize the orb with your configuration.


## Installation

Include the following script tag in your HTML file, ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```bash
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tixae-labs/react-voice-orb@latest/dist/voice-orb.min.js"></script>
```
After loading the script, initialize the Voice Orb by calling its global initializer. Add the following snippet to your page:

```bash
<script>
  // Initialize the Voice Orb widget
  window.VoiceOrb.init({
    agentId: "YOUR_AGENT_ID",   // Replace with your agentId from Orova.
    region: "YOUR_REGION",      // Replace with your agent's region (e.g., "eu" or "na").
    targetElementId: "voice-orb-container", // The ID of the element where the orb should render
    
    // Additional configuration options can be added here
  });
</script>
```
