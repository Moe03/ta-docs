<Warning>
  Even if you want to connect instagram only or facebook messenger only you will still need to do the same setup mentioned in this tutorial.
</Warning>
### Setup facebook & instagram pages
<Note>
  This part in the tutorial will involve connecting your facebook page & instagram page to the same business portfolio, if you already have a business portfolio with the pages connected to it you can skip this.
</Note>

- Once this page has shown you've successfully connected both your facebook page and instagram to the same messenger and TIXAE Agents will be able to work now if connected to it!
<Warning>
If for some reason you get an error saying "Couldn't connect instagram page" or something similar make sure to enable 2FA on your facebook account AND your instagram account as meta currently has restrictions especially for new accounts both on facebook/instagram, most of these restrictions are fixed when you enable 2FA, tutorial: [here](https://help.instagram.com/566810106808145)
</Warning>

### Connect TIXAE Agents
- Once you've successfully complete all the steps you should now head to your [TIXAE Agents](https://voiceglow.org/) dashboard, if you don't have an account already we recommend signing in with meta as that makes the onboarding process seamless
- If you already have an account head to the agent you wnat to connect, channels tab > select instagram/facebook (they show the same thing) >

![9](/images/meta-tut/9.PNG)
- Head to the agent you want to connect > **Channels tab** > then press on <strong>Connect Meta Channels or Connect /Instagram/Facebook</strong> > **Continue with Meta**

![10](/images/meta-tut/10.PNG)
- After logging in to the **same account** you've used to setup the business portfolio with the facebook & instagram pages connected to it > **Select the SAME business portfolio that owns the pages** in this step
<Note>
Note: If you're concerned with fully white labelled solution to connect your clients' pages you can tell your client to add you as an admin to their business pages/portfolio (They probably run ads on meta and already have a business portfolio), if you manage a page it will still show in the last step so **you are not requried to own the business portfolio or the pages, you only need access to manage them (preferrably admin access.)**
</Note>
---
![11](/images/meta-tut/11.PNG)
- Choose the **same facebook page** you've added to the business portfolio here.
---
![12](/images/meta-tut/12.PNG)
- Choose the **same instagram page you've connected to the facebook page & the the business portfolio.**
---
![13](/images/meta-tut/13.PNG)
- Once you've choosen the correct pages, etc this page should show, **you can manage the connection anytime btween TIXAE Agents & your business portfolio & assets from this link.**
---
![14](/images/meta-tut/14.PNG)
- After the signin flow **the pages you've selected should appear here, you should then press continue on the page you want to connect**.
---
![15](/images/meta-tut/15.PNG)
- **Double check that the channel has connected** & if everything is done right you've connected your facebook/instagram pages to your AI agent!

### Notes, Meta rules & restrictions:
- **We automatically transcribe any voice messages to text for the AI agent**, you can disable this option in the agent > channels tab.
- Human handoff supports both facebook & instagram channels & 2 way text/images support from the dashboard.
- **Instagram web for some reason has a lot of issues with buttons not working properly or not showing up at all, we recommend using the mobile app for the best experience espeically during testing.**
- Meta has a lot of restrictions on new accounts especially if you're trying to connect instagram pages, **make sure to enable 2FA on both your facebook & instagram accounts.**
- There will always be a **24 hour window for sending messages** to any fb/ig pages after that you can only send messages to the page if the user has sent a message to the page first, this is a restriction by meta.
- **Meta requires you to always let the end user know that they're talking to a bot/AI agent & if a human handoff happened it is also a requirement to mention that they are no longer are speaking to a bot**, this is a requirement by meta and we automatically handle it for you.
- **If requested by the end user we will automatically delete any data we have on them from the conversation.**

<Note>
If you're wondering if these pages are actually connected to an AI agent then yes they are!
