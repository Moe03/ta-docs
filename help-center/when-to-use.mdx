### Pros of using Orova Agents
- Dealing with AI tends to need a lot of time especially with prompt engineering, setting up a DB, ensuring your agent's data is always up to date, and of course ability to stream the responses, use tools, and be more interactive is a must now, **mediocre chatbots are going to have bad results if you're a business & are not going to sell themselves if you're an agency.**

> **Without Orova Agents you'll need to handle:**
- DBs and conversational data.
- APIs to let you easily connect your agennt to any platform.
- Fast reliable backend & Websocket servers to stream responses.
- UI engine similar to what we have to let AI render buttons, cards, images, etc not just text.
- Multi-provider tools streaming engine that supports ANY LLM let the AI use tools during streaming responses for example to send an email, or book a meeting on your calendar.
- Creating a live handoff solution as you may need to connect to a human agent in some usecases, that involves setting up a whole frontend to manage the agent conversations/analytics/basic settings, etc. 
- Setting up a custom front-end to deploy your agent on your website, and setting up even more backend endpoints to handle connecting to Whatsapp/Facebook Messenger/Instagram/Discord..
- Etc..

> **Luckily, Orova Agents has all of this and more to try out right now for free! so you can focus on building your agent and not worry about the rest.** 

- The right way for you to build an agent for your business or for your clients is to **focus on the quality of the responses, that involves hours of prompt engineering, setting up the most perfect KB possible, A/B testing, tools setup & much more**, we let you focus on building the agent without worring about how to connect it to different channels/managing infrastructure or front-end.
- **Orova Agents is perfect for an agency or a business of any size that dont wan't to deal with all the hassle of setting a lot of infrastructure and wants the best practices in their hands to make their support/marketing channels AI first with powerful AI agents that they can setup in minutes and go live tonight.**

### Cons of using Orova Agents
- Now all the previous sounds good until you need to make really advanced integrations/custom UI (I dunno like if you want to add a 3D speaking model as the chat avatar for some reason ðŸ˜‚), **then you'll start hitting limits with Orova Agents, but these limits are only for anything related to the front-end (Web widget/Dashboard) (we are working on improving customizablity tremendously especially for developers)**, that said; our whole backend is controllable via the [REST API](/api-reference/agents/get) (you can easily create, edit agents, adjust prompts, add/delete KB docs from the API).
- **Voicglow is not a good fit for you if you're looking to build a completely custom front-end for your agent where CSS edits are not enough, or if you're looking to build a custom RAG solution where you control everything, do devops & control every bit yourself and generally have more time/resources to hire developers.**

### Conclusion
> **With Orova Agents**
>> **You can focus on building the best agent possible and let us handle the rest, saving a lot of time & resources, be able to deploy a professional agent that uses the latest best practices in AI on a lot of channels tonight.**

> **Without Orova Agents**
>> **You'll need to handle all the infrastructure, front-end, and backend yourself, in addition to developing & maintaining a complete solution from scratch which involves months of continous devops without tested quality gurantees.**

If I was an agency starting our Orova Agents would be perfect, letting me focus on developing the agent itself without worrying about delivery or creating my own platform as I could whitelabel entirety of Orova Agents for just 5 USD and get started right away!

In the future your clients will need custom features and I will need to move on to a more customized solution that Orova Agents, that's a path but there is also another path **where you can hire a complete dev team from Vocieglow to have your own version of it priotrizing your custom features, & providing 24/7 support, so instead of hiring someone on fiverr or doing it yourself we're always here to help out!**
