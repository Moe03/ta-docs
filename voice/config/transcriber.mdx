## 🌐 Step 2: Configure Language  

- Input the **2-character language code** that matches the target transcription language.  
  - For example:

## ⚙️ Step 3: Adjust Patience Factor  

The **Patience Factor** determines how long the transcriber will wait for the user to finish speaking before sending the response:  

- **Lower Values (e.g., 0.2)**: Faster response time but more impatience.  
- **Higher Values (e.g., 0.7)**: Longer waiting time for user input to finish.  

> **Default**: 0.5.

## 🚦 Advanced Settings  

If your transcriber provider offers advanced options, such as **custom models**, input the **Model ID** field:  

- **Model ID**: Use this if a new model has been released by the provider (e.g., Deepgram’s Beta models).  
- Ensure to test thoroughly before deployment.

## 📝 Example Use Case  

Here’s a simple scenario:  

1. **User**: "What time is my meeting tomorrow?"  
2. **Transcriber**: Converts voice into text: `"What time is my meeting tomorrow?"`  
3. The **AI** processes the text and generates a response.
