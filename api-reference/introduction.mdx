## First of all please know your account region from the dashboard to know which endpoint to use from these:
Anything with /v2/ at the beginning will be using these endpoints:
#### V2 EU Region:
https://eu-vg-edge.moeaymandev.workers.dev
#### V2 NA Region:
https://na-vg-edge.moeaymandev.workers.dev

Anything with /v3/ at the beginning will be using these endpoints:
#### V3 EU Region:
https://eu-Orova Agents-runtime-vbmbkqccuq-ey.a.run.app
#### V3 NA Region:
https://na-runtime.Orova Agents.org

<Warning>If you use the incorrect endpoint the API will not work.</Warning>

## Authorization
- We use Bearer token to authorize any request for agents (except for public interact, analytics endpoints), workspaces, Kb, conversations, analytics, etc
- You can use either the <strong>agent secret</strong> key or the <strong>workspace secret</strong>, both are present in your dashboard.

## Agent Platforms
- You can currently interact with VG through either the built in AI engine or through Voiceflow, the <strong>agentPlatform</strong> defines how the agent will interact and function across the whole service.
- The [interact API of voiceflow](https://developer.voiceflow.com/reference/stateinteract-1) inspires how we interact with VF/VG agents, when you do an interact POST request the <strong>action</strong> property functions the same as that on Voiceflow's end.
