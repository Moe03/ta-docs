## Universal Code Snippets

Regardless of the platform you're using, these code snippets form the basis of your Orova integration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Popup Widget">
    ```html
    <div id="VG_OVERLAY_CONTAINER"></div>
    <script defer>
        (function() {
            window.VG_CONFIG = {
                ID: "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
                region: 'eu', // or 'na' for North America
                render: 'bottom-right', // or 'bottom-left'
                stylesheets: [
                    "https://vg-bunny-cdn.b-cdn.net/vg_live_build/styles.css",
                ],
            }
            var VG_SCRIPT = document.createElement("script");
            VG_SCRIPT.src = "https://vg-bunny-cdn.b-cdn.net/vg_live_build/vg_bundle.js";

    <script defer>
        (function() {

                ],
            }
            var VG_SCRIPT = document.createElement("script");
            VG_SCRIPT.src = "https://vg-bunny-cdn.b-cdn.net/vg_live_build/vg_bundle.js";
            VG_SCRIPT.defer = true;
            document.body.appendChild(VG_SCRIPT);
        })()
    </script>
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Iframe">

    Iframes introduce a whole new range of usecases with the huge variety of applications Orova Agents brings to the table. 

    Integrating as a more integral part of websites, platforms or internal helper agents, iframes are a good way to point to your agent without the need to render the script directly on the site, where it might conflict with other scripts. The same with CSS as it might (in some cases - very rare) affect a sites stylesheet. Some popular use-cases are:


    - **Integrate on platform:** Make the agent available to use in your own platform, whether it be PowerBI, Slack, Teams or Monday.com it can easily be put in wherever you want.
    - **Use the agent as its own addon on your SaaS platorm:** This is an increasingly popular way to integrate AI in no-time and at the same time offer your users a new feature where you can charge a monthly retainer fee or make it custom for each client with a set-up fee and a credit based subscription model. The possibilities are many. For more information read our [sales doc]() **(COMING SOON)**.
    - **Use as a part of webnsite layout:** Put the iframe direclty on the front page instead of as a traditional chatbot bubble. This makes for a unique experience that users will definitely appreciate (keep in mind - works best on iPad or PC). Another integration that has increasing popularity is replacing the FAQ page entirely, and giving it all to your AI agent. This will supercharge your FAQ page with natural language, tools and interactive UI elements.
    - **Send it as a URL:** This is a fantastic way to share your agent—simply connect it to a button that points to the iframe’s source URL. You can easily send it via email or embed it on your website. The possibilities are endless and its only your creativity that sets the limits. 
    
    - *We cant wait to see all your awesome integrations and use-cases - feel free to share them with us, either via [discord]() or make [Gia]() send it.*

    ```html
    <iframe
        src="https://voiceglow.org/app/eu/render/YOUR_AGENT_ID/iframe"
        style="width: 100%; height: 100vh;"
        frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Always replace `YOUR_AGENT_ID` with your actual Orova Agent ID in all code snippets.
</Note>

## Key Configuration Options

The `VG_CONFIG` object in the script allows for customization of your agent's behavior and appearance:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ID">
    Your unique Orova Agent identifier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="region">
    Set to 'eu' for Europe or 'na' for North America, based on your account region.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="render">
    Controls the chatbot's position: 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', or 'full-width'.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="stylesheets">
    Array of CSS stylesheets to customize the chatbot's appearance.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Configuration Options

You can further customize your chatbot by adding these optional parameters to the `VG_CONFIG` object:

```javascript
window.VG_CONFIG = {
    // ... other config options ...
    user: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        email: 'johndoe@example.com',
        phone: '+1234567890',
    },
    userID: 'CUSTOM_USER_ID',
    autostart: true,
}
```

<Tip>
  Providing user data can enhance the personalization of your agents interactions. The `autostart` option, when set to `true`, will open the widget automatically when a user visits your site.
</Tip>
