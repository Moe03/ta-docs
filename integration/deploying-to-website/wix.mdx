## Troubleshooting

**If you encounter issues with your TIXAE Agent widget integration:**

1. Verify that you've copied the entire code snippet correctly into the HTML iframe.

2. Double-check that you've replaced `YOUR_AGENT_ID` with your actual TIXAE Agent ID.

3. Ensure you've applied the custom code to all pages (or the specific pages where you want the widget to appear).

4. Clear your browser cache and refresh your Wix website to see changes.

5. If the widget doesn't appear, try adding it as a `custom code element` from the Wix editor instead. 

<Note>
  Wix may sometimes cache your site, which can delay the appearance of new elements. If you don't see the widget immediately after publishing, wait a few minutes and try again.
