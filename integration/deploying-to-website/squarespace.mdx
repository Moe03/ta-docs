## Customization Options

You can customize your widget's behavior and appearance by adjusting the `VG_CONFIG` options:

  <Accordion title="Change Position">
    Modify the `render` option to 'bottom-left' or 'bottom-right' to change the widget's position.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Autostart Chat">
    Add `autostart: true,` to the `VG_CONFIG` object to have the widget open automatically when a user visits your website.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom Styling">
    Add your own CSS file to the `stylesheets` array for custom styling:
    ```javascript
    stylesheets: [
        "https://vg-bunny-cdn.b-cdn.net/vg_live_build/styles.css",
        "https://your-custom-css-url.css"
    ],
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Orova Agent widget integration:

1. Verify that you've copied the entire code snippet correctly into the Header section of Code Injection.

2. Double-check that you've replaced "YOUR_AGENT_ID" with your actual Orova Agent ID.

3. Ensure you've saved the changes in the Code Injection page.

4. Clear your browser cache and refresh your Squarespace website to see changes.

5. If the widget doesn't appear, try adding the code to the Footer section instead of the Header section in Code Injection.

<Note>
  Squarespace may take a few minutes to propagate changes across their content delivery network. If you don't see the widget immediately after saving, wait a few minutes and try refreshing your site again.
