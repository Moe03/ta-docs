## Implementation Guide

**To integrate your TIXAE Agent using an iframe, follow these steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Agent's Iframe URL">
    1. Log in to your TIXAE Dashboard
    2. Navigate to your agent and click on `Deploy` in the upper right.
    3. Copy the iframe code snippet located beneath `iframe` 

    <img src="/images/deploy_iframe.png" width="500" />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Integration Method">
    Decide where and how you want to embed your agent **(e.g., website, platform, shareable link)**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Iframe Code">
    Insert the iframe code into your chosen location. Here's a basic example:

    ```html
    <iframe
      src="https://voiceglow.org/app/eu/render/YOUR_AGENT_ID/iframe"
      style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"
      frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    ```

    <Warning>
      Replace `YOUR_AGENT_ID` with your actual TIXAE Agent ID.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Appearance">
    Adjust the iframe's `width`, `height`, and other attributes to fit your specific use case.


    We like to set the `border radius` to the same as your agent as this makes for a more complete style.
    ```html
    <iframe
      src="https://voiceglow.org/app/eu/render/YOUR_AGENT_ID/iframe"
      width="550" height="650" style={{borderRadius: '1.2rem' }}
      frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    ```
    <Accordion title="See it in action">

    **This is the iframe above:**

      <iframe
      src="https://voiceglow.org/app/eu/render/wca8mwi90qwbrj57/iframe"
      width="550" height="650" style={{borderRadius: '1.2rem' }} frameborder="0">
