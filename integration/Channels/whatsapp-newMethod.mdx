### Troubleshooting

- **Verification Code Not Received:** Ensure your phone number is correct and capable of receiving SMS messages. If the issue persists, try requesting a new code.
- **Number Already Connected:** Make sure the phone number you are using is not linked to any existing WhatsApp account. If it is, you will need to disconnect it from WhatsApp before proceeding.
- **Connection Issues:** If the **Connect** button does not change to **Connected**, try refreshing the page or re-initiating the connection process.
