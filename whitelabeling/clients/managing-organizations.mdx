<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate Agents">
    Find the agent list on the **right side** of the Client tab.
  </Step>

    Use the **search bar** at the top of the agent list to find specific agents quickly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag and Drop">
    **Click and drag** the desired agent(s) from the right side list onto the client's organization in the left side list.
  </Step>
