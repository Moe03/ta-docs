## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. **How is the credit price calculated?**

The final credit price combines the agency owner’s set price with our base price. For example:

- Agency Owner Price: `$0.004`
- Orova Base Price: `$0.002`
- **Final Price**: `$0.006`

### 2. **What happens when a customer makes a payment?**

When a customer pays for credits:

1. Orova Agents deducts the **base credit price** for each purchased credit.
2. A **5% service fee** is applied to the agency owner’s margin.

<Tip>
  Example: If your margin per credit is `$0.004`, we will take `5%` of `$0.004`,
  resulting in a `0.0002` fee per credit.
</Tip>

### 3. **Can customers set up automatic charges?**

Yes! Customers can enable **Auto Charge**, which allows them to set a credit threshold. When their credits drop below this threshold, their account is automatically charged the amount they predefined.

### 4. **Can customers buy prepaid credits?**

Absolutely. Customers can purchase predefined credit packages:

- **1000 credits**
- **2000 credits**
- **3000 credits**

### 5. **How are credits consumed by agents?**

Once billing is enabled for an organization:

- All agents assigned to the organization will consume **org credits** instead of workspace credits.
- When the organization’s credits reach **0**, agents will stop functioning until credits are recharged.

<Tip>
  Agency owners can monitor credit consumption and transfer credits if needed.
</Tip>

### 6. **Can agency owners transfer credits?**

Yes, agency owners can transfer credits between:

- **Workspace → Organization**
- **Organization → Workspace**

This is managed through the **Org Info** section or **Credit Transfer** tool.

Agency owners can grant billing access to specific users in the organization:

  financial operations.

### 8. **What is Orova's service fee?**

Orova Agents charges a **5% fee** on the agency owner’s margin after deducting the base credit price.

  This fee ensures a seamless billing experience with secure transactions and
  full Stripe integration.
</Tip>

### 9. **How are payouts handled?**

Payouts are processed directly to the agency owner’s connected **Stripe account**. Ensure your Stripe account is properly configured to receive payouts without delays.
