Adding users to your client organizations is a crucial step in setting up effective client management in Orova Agents. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing users for your client organizations.

## Accessing User Management

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Client Tab">
    Go to the `Client` tab in your Orova Agents dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Organization">
    Find the **client organization** you want to manage from the list on the left.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access User Management">
    Click the `Manage` button next to the organization name.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Initially, the user table will be empty. This is where your client's **team members** will be listed once added.
</Note>

## Adding a New User

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate User Creation">
    Click the `Add User` button in the top right corner of the user management screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter User Details">
    Fill out the necessary information for your client:
    - **Full Name**
    - **Email Address**
    - **Password** (You can either set a custom password or click the `Generate` button for a random secure password)
    - **Profile Photo** (Optional - select or drag and drop an image)

    <Warning>
        **Remember:** Request the correct information from your client about which email and name they want. The client will always be able to set their own details later. 
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set User Access Permissions">
    Configure the user's access levels by selecting the appropriate checkboxes:
    - `Org Admin`: Allows the user to edit organization info and create/invite new users for their team.
    - `Home`: Access to the dashboard overview
    - `Conversations`: View and manage chat transcripts
    - `Analytics`: Access to widget statistics
    - `Knowledge Base`: Ability to view and edit the KB
    - `Channels`: Manage connected channels
    - `Prompt`: Adjust the prompt, AI-model, UI-engine settings and more. 
    - `Settings`: Modify the widget settings. This is a selection of the settings found in your agents settings tab. 
    - `Custom Tab`: Access to any custom tabs you've created. See [custom tab]() docs for more info.

    <Note>
        We know agencies want heavier permission options. More premission customization options **COMING SOON**. We will also release a dedicated doc explaining the **settings tab**.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finalize">
    Click the `Add User` button to create the new user account.

</Steps>


    
    

<Tip>
  We recommend assigning the **first user** as the `Org Admin`. This allows them to manage their organization and add other team members as needed.

## Managing Existing Users

## Inviting Users to the Client Dashboard

After creating a user account, you can send an invitation for them to access their dashboard:

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Setup">
    Before sending an invitation, use the `Log in` button to view the dashboard as the client would, ensuring all settings and permissions are correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate User">
    Find the newly created user in the user management table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click the `Invite` button on the user's row.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Review the invitation details and click `Send Invite` to email the user their login information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The invitation email includes a link that **automatically** logs the client into their dashboard. Ensure the email address is correct before sending.
