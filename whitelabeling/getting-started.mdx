## What is Whitelabeling?
White-labeling in TIXAE Agents allows agencies to fully customize the chatbot experience under their own branding. This feature provides the flexibility for agencies to present the chatbot as part of their brand while managing multiple clients seamlessly.

### Key Benefits of White-Labeling
- **Brand Customization:** Customize the dashboard, chat interfaces, and client interactions to align with your brand.
- **Enhanced Client Relationships:** Offer a branded experience that makes your clients feel directly supported by your agency.
- **Efficient Management:** Use a single platform to manage multiple clients, chatbots, and user interactions without revealing third-party tools.

## White-Labeling in TIXAE Agents
The TIXAE Agents platform supports robust white-labeling features tailored for agencies, including client management, team access controls, and chat monitoring. Agencies can integrate AI-powered chatbots into their service offerings, enhancing value and engagement with each client.
