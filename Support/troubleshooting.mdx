### 4. CSS and z-index Issues

<Warning>  
**Cause**:  
This issue often occurs due to conflicting CSS on your website, especially when multiple elements have high `z-index` values or global styles override the chatbotâ€™s default styles.  
</Warning>

<Card>  
**Symptoms**:  
- The chat widget is hidden behind other elements on the webpage.  
- The styles of the chatbot or dashboard appear broken or misaligned.  
</Card>

<Card>
**Solutions**:  
1. **Check z-index Conflicts**:  
   - Inspect the chat widget using browser developer tools.  
   - Ensure the widget has a sufficiently high `z-index` (e.g., `9999`) so it appears above other elements.  

2. **Audit Global Styles**:  
   - Look for global CSS rules that might override the chatbotâ€™s default styles.
