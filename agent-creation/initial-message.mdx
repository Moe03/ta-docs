## Overview  
 

The initial message in TIXAE Agents allows you to set predefined starter messages that your AI agent sends every time a new user interacts with the widget. These messages help set the tone and provide initial guidance to users.  

You can add multiple variants of the initial message, and a random variant will be shown to the user each time for a **unique experience**. You also have the option to generate new variants using AI, which can save time and effort.
