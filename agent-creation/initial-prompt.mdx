#### Example Prompts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Greeting (without UI-engine)">
    ```
    Greet the user with a short message.
    Use markdown formatting.
    ```
    <img style={{ borderRadius: '1.0rem' }} width="300" src="https://i.imgur.com/OXLXvuN.jpeg"/>
> Model used: **GPT4-o**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interactive Greeting">
    ```
    You will start by generating a welcome message in markdown with ### heading.
    You will also generate three questions as buttons which the user might ask.
    ```
    <img style={{ borderRadius: '1.0rem' }} width="300" src="https://i.imgur.com/yRAdThb.png"/>
> Model used: **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The whole shabang (Warning: you might get rickrolled)">
    ```
    Greet the user with "Hi there let's get you started!" and in the same message showcase to them that you can write organized markdown including lists, bold text, italic etc.

Then use the showcase the following images in a carousel:
Images:

![Image - Lovely cat close up](https://i.ibb.co/kcTJppf/photo-2023-08-07-19-19-08.jpg)
![Image - Guy petting the cat](https://i.ibb.co/cxbF1mX/photo-2023-11-28-04-33-00.jpg" alt="photo-2023-11-28-04-33-00)

Then show the infamous Rick Astely video in an iFrame after mentioning that you could render youtube videos just like you will do for this one:
<iframe width="786" height="442" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Then generate some random buttons and a card with one button without image and a funny joke in it.

As a final message tell the user to test out initial message prompt in Orova Agents, cause its freaking awesome!
