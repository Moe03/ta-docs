**Font family**: Choose from any of the free [Google fonts](Google_font). 

Example: `DM Sans`


<Tip>
  You can change the fonts of specific parts (like header and input field) using **custom CSS**.
</Tip>

#
**Inherit Font**: Type "inherit" in the font input field to use the same font as webpage. Note: The widget must be put on the website for this to work.

<Warning type="warning">
  Not recommended, as this may break the agent – use at your own **risk**.

Customize the layout and look of the buttons used in your agent's interface. There are three options to consider with each unique uses cases. Example, `in footer` or `horizontal` is often used as a way to automatically generate follow up questions (**similar to microsoft co-pilot or perplexity**) to guide the user through the conversation with ease.

### 

You can choose between six predefined themes that work in both light and dark mode.

## Showcasing the agent

It's essential to know how the agent behaves and looks before launching on your website or letting a client test it. Orova Agents has two options for testing, right from the agent designer:



<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prototype:" icon="cubes">
    1.  Your clients will want to test a demo of their agent. Using the prototype link is a great way to do that. If you are in the whitelabeling program, the link will have your custom domain and branding!
    <img src="/images/prototype_screen_shots.png"></img>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Demo:" icon="presentation-screen">
    2. It's not always easy to visualize how the agent will look on a website. The demo link lets you test it out in chat bubble format, so you get an idea of how the agent will look your website. 

    <Tip> This is also a great way to test out custom CSS styling.</Tip>
