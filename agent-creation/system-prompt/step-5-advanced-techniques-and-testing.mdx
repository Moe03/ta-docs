  <Card title="Taking a deep breath" icon="wind">
    Encourage the AI to think methodically by using specific phrases like: "Take a deep breath and think about what you are going to respond before writing it." or "Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Highlighting Importance" icon="exclamation">
    Highlight the critical nature of the task with impactful phrases like "This is a life or death situation. It's critical that your response is correct." or "This is critical to the survival of my business."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Benefit of deep breath" icon="chart-line">
    This helps the AI to slow down and process the information more thoroughly, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Benefit of importance" icon="bullseye">
    This technique can make the AI prioritize accuracy and importance, resulting in more focused and precise outputs.

### Example Prompt Using Both Techniques

<CodeBlock>

```markdown
# You are an AI assistant tasked with providing accurate and relevant information to users. Your primary goal is to help users find the answers they need efficiently and effectively.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

## When responding to user queries, follow these guidelines:

1. Carefully read and understand the user's question.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Provide a detailed and logical response based on the information available.

This is a **life or death situation**. It's critical your response is correct.

### Steps for crafting the best possible prompt based on agent's performance or user feedback:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Test Scenarios">
    Develop a diverse set of test cases that cover various user intents and edge cases (Can be easily created with ChatGPT).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Responses">
    Assess the AI's responses for accuracy, relevance, and adherence to guidelines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Weaknesses">
    Note any areas where the AI's performance falls short of expectations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine the Prompt">
    Adjust the prompt to address identified weaknesses and improve overall performance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat">
    Continuously test and refine the prompt to achieve optimal results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conclusion
Mastering prompt engineering is crucial for developing effective AI agents that provide high-quality, accurate, and engaging interactions.
