AI thrives on context. In Orova AI, context comes from three primary sources: system prompt, user input, and the built-in knowledgebase.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Improved Accuracy" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    Context helps the AI understand the nuances of your query.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relevance" icon="filter">
    With proper context, the AI tailors its answers to your specific situation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency" icon="bolt">
    Clear context and a robust knowledge base reduce the need for follow-up questions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Personalization" icon="user-gear">
    The more context available, the more personalized the AI's responses become.

### Providing Effective Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    Clearly define the problem, audience, and desired outcome to keep responses relevant and contextually driven.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage the Knowledge Base">
    Orova Agent's knowledge base provides a layer of information on top of the model's training data, ensuring consistent and accurate responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Boundaries">
    Inform the AI about any limitations or constraints. This ensures the model always keeps to its task and context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Roles">
    Specify the role or persona the AI should adopt for more contextual interactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>
#
<Warning>
While more context is generally better, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on details that directly impact the model's task.

## Setting boundaries and restrictions
#
When deploying an AI agent for your clients, it's essential to define clear restrictions and boundaries. This helps reduce hallucinations (like recommending the wrong product) and ensure safe, accurate, and appropriate interactions.
<Tip>
Together with prompting, **Temperature** sets the level of randomness in the AI's responses. For more details on how to adjust temperature settings and its effects, [read more here](#temperature-settings).

Guidelines for Setting Restrictions and Boundaries
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Scope of Responses" icon="bullseye">
    Clearly specify topics the AI should address to prevent irrelevant information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Information Sources" icon="database">
    Restrict the AI to verified information from the knowledge base for consistency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Interactions" icon="users">
    Define handleable queries and provide fallback responses for out-of-scope questions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Functional Limitations" icon="ban">
    Outline actions the AI cannot perform to set clear expectations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Actions" icon="gears">
    Specify how to use the UI Engine and Tools in the system prompt.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Warning>
Defining clear restrictions is crucial for preventing the AI from engaging in potentially harmful or inappropriate behavior.
