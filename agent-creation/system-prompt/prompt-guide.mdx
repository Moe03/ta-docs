#

## Step 1: Define the Tone and Objective
#
Clearly articulate the AI's role, personality, and primary goals. This sets the foundation for all interactions.

<Info>
Orova Agents are masters of personality, capable of adopting a wide range of tones and styles to suit your needs. Whether you want a casual chatbot or a professional assistant, you can customize the agent's persona to fit your requirements.
</Info>
#
<Tip>
**Experiment** with different personas to find the perfect fit for your audience or client. Try these options:

- Set the tone to `slang` for a laid-back and fun personality that will resonate with many customers.
- Request a `nerdy` and tech-savvy personality for tech blogs or e-commerce.
- Go for a `poetic` style for a book store or blog.
</Tip>

Here are some tone setters you can try. Copy and paste them into the system instructions of your agent:
#
<CodeGroup>
```markdown Friendly Tone
You are a friendly and patient tutor specializing in high school mathematics. Your goal is to help students understand complex concepts by breaking them down into simpler terms and providing relatable examples.
```

```markdown Professional Tone
You are a professional financial advisor with expertise in retirement planning. Your objective is to provide clear, concise, and accurate information to clients about various retirement savings options and strategies.
```

```markdown Casual Tone
You're a laid-back virtual travel buddy with a knack for finding hidden gems in popular tourist destinations. Your mission is to help travelers discover unique experiences that are off the beaten path.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 2: AI + Context = Truth
#
AI thrives on context. In Orova Agents, context comes from three primary sources: system prompt, user input, and the built-in knowledgebase.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Improved Accuracy" icon="bullseye-arrow">
    Context helps the AI understand the nuances of your query.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Relevance" icon="filter">
    With proper context, the AI tailors its answers to your specific situation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency" icon="bolt">
    Clear context and a robust knowledge base reduce the need for follow-up questions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Personalization" icon="user-gear">
    The more context available, the more personalized the AI's responses become.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
#
### Providing Effective Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    Clearly define the problem, audience, and desired outcome to keep responses relevant and contextually driven.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage the Knowledge Base">
    Orova Agent's knowledge base provides a layer of information on top of the model's training data, ensuring consistent and accurate responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Boundaries">
    Inform the AI about any limitations or constraints. This ensures the model always keeps to its task and context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Roles">
    Specify the role or persona the AI should adopt for more contextual interactions.
  </Step>
</Steps>
#
<Warning>
While more context is generally better, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on details that directly impact the model's task.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Example: E-commerce wine store prompt">
```markdown
You are an AI customer support agent for an e-commerce wine store. Your role is to provide helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable assistance to customers who have questions or concerns about our products, orders, or services. Always maintain a professional and courteous demeanor.

Here is the important information about our wine store:
<wine_store_info>
{{WINE_STORE_INFO}}
</wine_store_info>

Guidelines for customer interaction:
1. Greet politely and thank for contacting support.
2. Address concerns promptly and accurately.
3. Use provided wine store info for queries.
4. Recommend wines based on preferences, avoid health claims.
5. Explain wine terminology in simple terms if needed.
6. Empathize with dissatisfied customers and offer solutions.
7. Promote relevant deals or special offers.
8. End by asking if there's anything else to help with.

Respond to customer queries as follows:
1. Read and understand the question thoroughly.
2. Ask for clarification if necessary.
3. Provide clear, concise, and accurate responses.
4. Offer additional relevant information if appropriate.

<customer_query>
{{CUSTOMER_QUERY}}
</customer_query>

Please respond in this format:
<response>
[Your response here, following the guidelines above]
</response>
```

## Step 3: Implement Chain of Thought Reasoning
#
Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning guides AI models to break down complex tasks into logical, step-by-step processes, improving accuracy, reliability, and explainability of AI responses.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Understanding CoT">
    CoT reasoning mimics human problem-solving by encouraging the AI to:
    1. Analyze the problem
    2. Break it down into smaller, manageable parts
    3. Solve each part sequentially
    4. Combine the results to reach a final conclusion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Benefits">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Improved Accuracy" icon="check-double">
        Logical sequence reduces errors and incorrect conclusions.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Enhanced Explainability" icon="chalkboard-user">
        Step-by-step process improves user understanding.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Complex Task Handling" icon="puzzle-piece">
        Tackles complicated problems more effectively.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Reduced Hallucinations" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
        Grounding in logic decreases false or irrelevant information.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

### Implementing CoT in Prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Explicit Instructions">
    Tell the AI to think through the problem step-by-step. 
    Example: "Before providing your final answer, please break down the problem and solve it step-by-step."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Question Decomposition">
    Guide the AI to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable questions.
    Example: "To solve this, let's approach it in stages. First, what are the key components of the problem? Second, how do these components relate to each other? Third, ..."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intermediate Steps">
    Encourage the AI to show its work by providing intermediate results.
    Example: "As you solve this problem, please share your thought process at each stage, including any intermediate calculations or reasoning."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Logical Connectors">
    Use words like "therefore," "because," "as a result," to encourage logical connections between steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification Prompts">
    Ask the AI to verify its own work.
    Example: "After you've reached a conclusion, please review your steps and ensure they logically lead to your final answer."
  </Step>
</Steps>
