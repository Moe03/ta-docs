The **Tools Integration** feature allows you to connect external APIs or webhooks directly to nodes. This enables your AI agents to execute tasks, fetch data, or interact with third-party services.

---

## Adding Tools

1. Open the **Tools** tab in the node settings.
2. Click **Add Tool** to configure a new tool.
3. Enter the following:
   - **Tool Name**: A unique name for the tool.
   - **Server URL**: The endpoint of the API/webhook.
   - **Request Method**: Choose from `GET`, `POST`, etc.
   - **Variables**: Define input variables or use existing ones.

### Adding Tools via Text Editor

Tools can also be selected directly in the **Text Editor** using the `{` shortcut:

1. Open the **Text Editor** in the node's settings.
2. Type `{` to access a dropdown of available tools.
3. Select the tool you wish to use, and it will be added to the editor.

## Testing Tools

- Use the built-in **Test Tool** feature to verify the integration works as expected.
- Generate the tool's schema using the AI assistant for faster setup.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for tools to simplify debugging.
- Test each tool thoroughly before deploying the flow.
- Leverage AI schema generation to speed up configuration.

## Tool response
We highly recommend giving the AI a detailed human readable JSON response for the tool result, not providing that will make the AI struggle to understand what is going on, thus will hallucinate more.
