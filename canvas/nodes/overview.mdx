In the **Canvas** feature of Orova Agents, nodes form the building blocks for creating flexible, flow-based AI agent configurations. These nodes allow you to define specific behaviors, inputs, and outputs, making it easier to design complex interactions.

## Types of Nodes

1.  **Start Node**:

    - Automatically created and unique for every flow.
    - Marks the entry point of the conversation or interaction.
    - **Note**: You can only have one start node per flow.

2.  **Default Nodes**:

    - Represent operations or decision points within the flow.
    - Used to route data and manage the conversation logic.

3.  **End Nodes**:

    - Conclude the conversation, call, or chat.
    - Helps in marking logical endpoints for a flow.

4.  **Global Nodes**:

    - Accessible throughout the entire flow.
    - Created by toggling the **Global Node** switch on a default node.
    - Useful for defining reusable functionality, such as shared prompts or tools.

## Customizing Nodes

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '20px' }}>
  <div>
    Clicking on any node (start, default, global) opens a menu with the following customization options:

    ### 1. **Overview**
    - Define the node's name and description for clarity.
    - Assign specific instructions for AI behavior when routing through this node.

    ### 2. **LLM Configuration**
    - Set parameters like temperature, token limits, and other model-specific options.
    - Tailor how the AI responds within this specific node.

    ### 3. **Tools Integration**
    - Connect tools (e.g., APIs or webhooks) to the node.
    - Define the tools the AI can call when processing this part of the flow.

    ### 4. **Knowledge Base**
    - Enable the AI to retrieve relevant information from a vector database.
    - Specify the number of retrieval chunks and adjust the settings for knowledge-based responses.

    ### 5. **Router Configuration**
    - Manage conditional logic for branching flows.
    - Add conditions to define how the data moves between nodes.

## Examples and Use Cases

### Node Type Examples

1. **Start Node Example**:

   - Greet the user warmly and provide a welcome message.
     ![Start Node Example](/assets/start_node.png)  
     _The Start Node configuration menu showing the greeting prompt setup._

2. **Default Node Example**:

   - Process the user's input and provide a response.
     ![Default Node Example](/assets/default_node.png)  
     _The Default Node configuration menu showing the processing prompt setup._

3. **End Node Example**:

   - Conclude the conversation with a friendly closing message.
     ![End Node Example](/assets/end_node.png)  
     _The End Node configuration menu showing the closing prompt setup._

4. **Global Node Example**:
   - Define a shared prompt for handling "Help" requests.

     _The Global Node configuration menu showing the help prompt setup._

### Scheduling Assistant Example

Imagine building a scheduling assistant with the following flow:

- The **Start Node** greets the user and identifies their intent.
- A **Default Node** processes the scheduling details using integrated tools.
- A **Global Node** defines shared responses like "Help" or "Cancel."
- The **End Node** finalizes the booking or provides a summary.
