Nodes are the backbone of the **Canvas** feature in TIXAE Agents, allowing you to define specific tasks and behaviors within your agent's flow. This guide walks you through the process of creating and managing nodes effectively.

## How to Create Nodes

### 1. Default Nodes

Default nodes are the primary nodes you’ll use to build your flow.

**Steps to Create**:

1. Click on the **Default Node** option on the left-side panel.
2. Drag and drop the node into the Canvas workspace.
3. Customize the node by clicking on it to access the settings menu.

---

### 2. Global Nodes

Global nodes are reusable nodes accessible across the entire flow.

**Steps to Create**:

1. Create a **Default Node** as explained above.
2. Open the **Overview** tab in the node settings.
3. Toggle the **Global Node** switch to enable global functionality.

**Tip**: Use global nodes for common tasks like “Help” or “Cancel” commands.

---

### 3. End Nodes

End nodes conclude the conversation or flow.

**Steps to Create**:

1. Click on the **End Node** option on the left-side panel.
2. Drag and drop it to the desired position in the flow.
3. Link it to other nodes to define the logical endpoint.

## Managing Nodes

After creating nodes, managing them effectively ensures a seamless flow design.

### 1. Customizing Node Behavior

Click on a node to open its customization menu, which includes:

- **Overview**: Set the node's name, description, and instructions.
- **LLM Configuration**: Adjust AI response settings like temperature and token limits.
- **Tools**: Integrate external APIs or tools for specific actions.
- **Knowledge Base**: Enable AI to retrieve relevant knowledge from a database.
- **Router Configuration**: Define conditions for branching flows.

### 2. Connecting Nodes

Connect nodes by dragging the connector from one node to another:

- **Start Node** to **Default Nodes** for initial interactions.
- **Default Nodes** to **End Nodes** to finalize conversations.
- **Global Nodes** anywhere in the flow for reusable tasks.

### Example: Simple Flow Creation

1. Start with a **Start Node** that greets the user.
2. Add a **Default Node** to process the user’s input.
3. Include a **Global Node** for a "Cancel" command.
4. End the flow with an **End Node** thanking the user.

## Tips for Efficient Node Management

- Use **Global Nodes** for repetitive tasks to save time and effort.
- Regularly test your flow by using the built-in tools and preview features.
- Clearly label nodes to maintain clarity in complex flows.
