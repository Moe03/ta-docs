Building an AI agent is a multi-step process that requires careful planning and execution. With the **Canvas** feature, Orova Agents revolutionizes how you design and manage AI-powered agents by introducing a flow-based interface for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

## What does it take to create an AI agent?

Creating an AI agent involves several critical steps:

- **Define the agent's purpose and goals**: Identify the primary tasks and objectives your AI should focus on.
- **Design the agent's appearance and voice**: Establish a brand-consistent persona for your agent.
- **Train the agent**: Equip the agent with the knowledge to handle user queries effectively.
- **Deploy the agent**: Integrate the agent into websites, apps, or other platforms.
- **Monitor and optimize performance**: Continuously evaluate and improve the agent's functionality and accuracy.
- **So many channels**: Integrate the agent into so many channels including but not limited to: Web, whatsapp, FB Messenger, Instagram, telegram, realtime voice via web or twilio and basically any channel through our API[/api-reference/agents/interact/post].

Among these steps, the **prompting** process is pivotal. The more selective and specific your inputs are, the higher the quality of responses you can expect.

## Why Orova Agents' Canvas?

Most systems today operate with a single system prompt and a limited set of tools. While this approach works for basic AI tasks, it falls short for more complex scenarios. For example, imagine building:

- An advanced AI **scheduling agent** that handles multiple scenarios simultaneously.
- An AI capable of leveraging **10+ tools** while maintaining performance and relevance.

Such use cases demand a more flexible and modular system. This is where **Canvas** shines.

## What makes Canvas unique?

Canvas empowers you to overcome traditional AI limitations by offering:

- **Custom system prompts and tools**: Configure unique prompts and toolsets for every scenario.
- **Flow-based design**: Break down large prompts into smaller, reusable prompts connected through logical flows.
- **Realtime interactions**: Stream responses to users in real-time for voice-to-voice or text-based interactions.
- **Global and reusable nodes**: Share functionality across multiple flows, improving efficiency and reducing redundancy.
- **Advanced configurations**: Tailor the AI's responses using model settings for precision in every interaction.

## The Future of AI Agents

With Canvas, you're no longer confined by the rigidity of a single prompt or toolset. Whether you're designing a virtual assistant for customer support, a scheduling agent, or a knowledge-sharing bot, Canvas provides the flexibility and power you need to create world-class AI solutions.
